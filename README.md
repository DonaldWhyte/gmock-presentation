# Introduction to Google Mock

Presentation on Google Mock.

## Running Presentation

Install dependencies and run serve presentation using a local web server like so:

```
npm install
grunt serve
```

The presentation can now be accessed on `localhost:8080`. Note that this web application is configured to bind to hostname `0.0.0.0`, which means that once the Grunt server is running, it will be accessible from external hosts as well (using the current host's public IP address).
